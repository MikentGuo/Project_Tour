        <h2>Xian Dumpling Dinner</h2>
        <p class="text"> Whether you are travell-ing in the north or the south of China, one delicacy you are almost
          sure to find on
          the menu is the dumpling. A universal favourite, the Chinese dumpling has a long history and is an essential
          part of celebra-tory meals such as those prepared for the Chinese lunar Spring Festival. The dumpling can be
          anything from a quick snack to a delicacy with which to entertain family and friends or the basis of a
          veritable feast.

          A well-loved story tells how long ago during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD) a doctor named Zhang
          Zhongjing travelled back to his hometown in the county of Nanyang. He found the people were suffering from
          an outbreak of typhoid and dying from hunger and cold. In fact the weather was so cold that many had
          frostbitten ears to add to their troubles. The kindly doctor set about concocting a mixture of mutton,
          cayenne and a special medicine that he wrapped in a piece of ear-shaped dough. The dumplings he created were
          fed to the starving people and by New Year's Eve, not only were they saved from the typhoid epidemic but
          also their frost bitten ears were healed. The doctor's fame became legendary and thus the dumpling became a
          favourite addition to the Chinese diet.

          Xian, an ancient city that has been the nation's capital during no less than eleven dynasties spanning
          more than a thousand years is regarded as the home if not the birthplace of the great dumpling tradition. It
          was here that the art of creating the most tasty and delicate of dumplings was refined and no visit to the
          city is complete unless you partake of a Dumpling Dinner.

          This is an experience for the dumpling connoisseur, the flavours, shapes and colours will tempt the
          palette, while the elegant names and stories attached to each variety are truly amazing. It is no less
          amazing that a simple way of preparing food has become so very popular and sophisticated that it is now
          considered to be as much a work of art as a tasty morsel.

          It is said that to visit Xian without seeing the fantastic Terracotta Army as well as having a Dumpling
          Dinner means that you have not really been to Xian at all!

        making a living but sell property. At last, they found the coffin In the small house. When the family opened
        It, there was the aromatic and freshly looking cured meat! Mrs. Fan sent It for sale In the market and It
        was well received. More people rushed to the family for the meat. Mrs. Fan put some fresh meat Into the
        juice. The newly cooked cured meat was just as delicious. Then the Fans’ fame of their cured meat went
        apace.

        <h2>Yang Rou Pao Mo (Crumbled Unleavened Bread Soaked in Mutton Stew)</h2>
        Yang Rou Pao Mo is a local dish that is enjoyed throughout Shaanxi Province but is particularly popular
        in Xi'an City as a traditional nourishing meal. Not only do the local people enjoy it on a regular basis;
        it is also often appreciated by visiting celebrities.


        A highly seasoned mutton gravy in which bread is soaked, Yang Rou Pau Mo smells and tastes great. When
        the weather is cold, this dish is a sure way to warm you up! Many restaurants in Xi'an serve Yang Rou Pao
        Mo but among the best known is the Lao Sun Jia, established in 1898 and the Tong Sheng Xiang where they
        have been serving excellent food for almost a century. Both establishments can be recommended if you wish
        to try this special dish.
        How Yang Rou Pau Mo is served. The custom is both unique and interesting. When you order the meal you
        will be given a large bowl and a quantity of round, flat unleavened bread (nan bread). The amount of bread
        depends entirely upon the size of your appetite! You have to break the bread into small pieces so that it
        can absorb the flavor of the liquid. Be warned, the bread is hard and it will prove something of a test of
        strength for your fingers but the smaller you break the pieces, the better the result. Once you have
        prepared your bread, you pass your bowl to the chef who will stir it into a pot of hot mutton soup. After
        some five to ten minutes he will ladle the soup and bread back into your bowl with a quantity of mutton.

        Adding chili paste, caraway and a specially salted sweet garlic enhances the dish. These together act to
        reduce the greasiness so often associated with mutton.
        Yang Rou Pao Mo might not sound as though it could become a favorite with you but if you are seeking to
        experience something of the local food of the people of western China, this is well worth a try. If you
        want to taste it at its best, remember to come to Xi'an.
