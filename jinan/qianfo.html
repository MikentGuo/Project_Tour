                The Thousand Buddha Mountain is a hill located about 2.5 kilometers southeast of the city of Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, 
                China. It covers 1.518 square kilometers (375.1 acres) and has a peak of 285 meters (935 ft) above sea level. It is renowned for its 
                numerous Buddha images which have been carved out of the hill's rock faces or free-standing structures erect since the times of the 
                Sui Dynasty (581-618) and its Xingguochan Temple. It is considered one of the "Three Greatest Attractions in Jinan" together with 
                Baotu Spring and Daming Lake. It is also one of the 4A-rated Tourist attractions in China.
