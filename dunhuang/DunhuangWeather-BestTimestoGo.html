            <p>The best season to see Dunhuang and to take a Silk Road tour is from June to October, when the temperatures are most suitable — especially from September to October, when you can taste freshly harvested local fruits, such as watermelons, apricots, and grapes.
            </p>
            <p>Dunhuang has an extremely arid continental climate, which has three main characteristics:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li >lots of sunshine</li>
                <li>little rain</li>
                <li>four distinct seasons</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The annual average for sunshine hours in Dunhuang is 3,200 — well over 10 hours a day in the tourist season. The hottest month is July when the average temperature is 25°C (76°F); the coldest month is January, with an average temperature of -8°C (17°F).
            </p>
            <p>The annual average precipitation in Dunhuang is only about 40 mm. The meager 1½ inches mostly falls from June to August, with 15 mm in July.
            </p>
            <p>Winter is long and chill in Dunhuang, usually lasting from mid-October to early April. From March to May, the temperature rises gradually, but sandstorms are common in spring.
