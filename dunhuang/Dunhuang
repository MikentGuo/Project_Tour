Dunhuang Travel Guide - How to Plan a Trip to Dunhuang

As an important stop on the ancient Silk Road, Dunhuang once presided over the only channel from China’s Central Plains to Central Asia and even to Europe. The “world’s four ancient civilizations” of China, India, Greece, and Islam co-mingled there, making Dunhuang an international stage full of exotic customs and ancient legends.

Located at the westernmost end of the Hexi Corridor, Dunhuang is a county-level city in Gansu Province. Dunhuang means ‘grand’, and it was also called Shazhou — ‘Sandy Prefecture’ — historically, because the city is located at the edge of a charming desert, known as the Singing Sand Mountains.

Things to Do in Dunhuang

Dunhuang used to be an important city on the ancient Silk Road, and now it is a famous historical and cultural city of China attracting many tourists from China and abroad. In Dunhuang, you can see the spectacular Gobi Desert wonders, appreciate the amazing cave art, and discover its profound history of more than 2,000 years.

Dunhuang was a place full of stories and legends of the Silk Road and it is famous for its Buddhist mural heritage in the Mogao Grottoes. Dunhuang was also an important military area in Chinese history. Yumenguan, Yangguan, and the Great Wall of the Han Dynasty (mostly built by 121 BC, it existed much earlier than the Beijing Great Wall) were all important defense projects, which are also now among Dunhuang’s famous tourist attractions.

1. Bask in History and Art in the Mogao Caves

Situated about 25 km (15 mi) from Dunhuang City, the Mogao Caves are also known as the Thousand Buddha Caves. They house a large area of cave-wall murals covering Buddhist history, Buddhist legends, and social life including hunting, farming, textiles, transportation, war, construction, dance, marriage, and funerals. Do you want to know what the life of the ancients was like? Or have you ever imagined what a Buddhist worldview is like? These vivid scenes will reveal it for you.

The Mogao Grottoes is the largest and most abundant Buddhist art area in the world. It is praised as an "art museum in the desert". You can find out more about the Mogao Caves here.

In order to protect the murals and carvings, the number of visitors per day to the Mogao Caves is restricted, so we suggest booking a Dunhuang trip as early as you can.

2. Enjoy Desert Dreams on the Singing Sand Mountains

The Singing Sand Mountains are also called the Mingsha Sand Dunes, named because of the phenomenon of the “singing sand” (mingsha). The sand dunes cover an area 40 kilometers across, embracing Crescent Spring. The Singing Sand Mountains are steep and their ridgeline is as sharp as a blade.

Camal riding is a popular way to visit the ‘sand mountains’, traveling (albeit briefly) as the caravans crossed the desert thousands of years ago. We recommend the sand-proof shoe covers that you can rent at the scenic spot.  

3. See a Classic Oasis at Crescent Spring

Known as "the First Spring in the Desert”, Crescent Spring is located at the foot of the Singing Sand Mountains. It is nearly 100 meters long from north to south, and about 25 meters wide from east to west. It is so named because its shape looks like a crescent moon. It is the quintessential oasis.

Crescent Spring is always visited together with the Singing Sand Mountains, and the best time to visit is at dusk when the sun is setting slowly over the dunes, bathing them in pink and gold and casting long shadows.

4. Savor Yardang National Geopark — Ghost City

Situated about 200 kilometers (130 miles) west of Dunhuang, Yardang National Geological Park is famous for its unique “Yardang landforms” formed by wind erosion. When night falls, the park’s zephyrs scream awfully through the rocks, like ghouls, so it is also called “Ghost City”.

Travelers should visit Yardang National Geological Park using the different northern and southern routes. The sunset views at the park are wonderful and you should not miss them.
